/**
 * Asset Refresh Service (Enhanced)
 * 
 * This service provides a centralized way to refresh asset values
 * throughout the application. It helps avoid circular dependencies
 * and prevents infinite render loops in React components.
 * 
 * The enhanced version includes:
 * - Better error handling
 * - Detailed logging
 * - Multi-stage refresh for reliability
 * - Update verification
 * - Market hour awareness (stock prices only update during market hours)
